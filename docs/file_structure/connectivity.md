Connectivity group
------------------

The connectivity information is stored as tuples in the group
`/connectivity`. The tuples are pairs, triples, etc. as needed and may be either
time-independent or time-dependent.
Several connectivity elements may be defined for any particles group.
A connectivity element may only refer to a single particle group.

The tuples of particles are interpreted according to the section
[Storage of particles and tuples lists](#storage-of-particles-and-tuples-lists).
